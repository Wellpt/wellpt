# Hello, it is a pleasure to receive your visit! ðŸ‘‹
My name is Wellington Nobre.

About me

 ðŸ”Ž I am in the process of career migration, I have 15 years of experience in telecommunications, but I have always been passionate about technology since I was a child, but I had difficulty following this path, due to financial conditions. I got my first computer when I was 17, before lan houses were my only contact with a PC, but I didn't give up on finding my way back, first I walked the path of independence, and then I returned to a professional destination that I love, technology.

Graduated in system analysis and development, I work as a fullstack developer at OI. And I'm pursuing graduate school in software engineering.ðŸŽ“

One of the projects we worked on as a team was this: https://wellpt.github.io/ProjetoDev/ where we use several tools and work as a team.


âš¡ I recently completed the Fullstack Tech-Academy course with a SURREAL victory for my team at HACKATHON. In 5 days we developed a solution that, in addition to being sustainable, enchanted the evaluators with our code.

The project that led us to the victory of the HACKATHON Tech Academy: https://wellpt.github.io/TechTeamProject/
